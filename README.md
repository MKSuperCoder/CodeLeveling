# CodeLeveling
 
Inspiration:
 This project idea was inspired by an anime named Solo Leveling in which a character received a GUI that is only visible to him which gives him tasks to do to level up his combat skills. After completing each task, he gets rewarded points which he uses to upgrade his combat skills just like in a video game

What it does:
Code Leveling is a C++ GUI application designed to gamify the process of learning coding and data structures. It provides an interactive and engaging platform for users to enhance their programming skills through solving coding problems. The application includes the following features:
           1. Leveling System: Users earn points for successfully solving problems, which they can use to level up.
           2. Daily Quests & Sidequests: These quests challenge users to learn specific topics or solve problems within a given timeframe, helping them stay consistent in     their learning journey.
           
With its gamified approach, Code Leveling motivates users to stay engaged, improve their problem-solving skills, and deepen their understanding of programming and data structures. Whether you're tackling daily quests or defeating coding bosses, this application turns learning to code into an exciting adventure.


Challenges:
The biggest issue was that I had trouble importing the ui.qml files from qt design into qt creator. I had to recreate the files in qml in qt creator to add logic to them.
It was also hard to connect to the database from QT, so I had to learn how to do that. It was my first time making a sign up and login page, so it was hard to make it work.


Accomplishment:
Making the app functional
Connecting to the database
Making a signup and login page


What I have learned:
QT Creator/Design
Connecting the database to the c++ and qml files in QT Creator


Future Direction:
Make the app fully functional and working
Add a compiler
Add music
Release the app
Have BMCC students try it out and track their progress
